# Replicability 

The SPlisHSPlasH library implements the SPH methods developed by our and other research groups. This allows to reproduce the research results of the corresponding publications. Inspired by the [Graphics Replicability Stamp Initiative](http://www.replicabilitystamp.org/) we started to add scenes to the repository to reproduce some results in our papers:

### Jan Bender, Tassilo Kugelstadt, Marcel Weiler, Dan Koschier, "Implicit Frictional Boundary Handling for SPH", IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 2020

* Figure 7.a) can be replicated by loading the scene: data/Scenes/GridModel_Akinci2012.json
* Figure 7.b) can be replicated by loading the scene: data/Scenes/GridModel_Bender2019.json
